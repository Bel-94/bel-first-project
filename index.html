    <h2>About me</h2>
    <h3>My background</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in <strong>Nanyuki.</strong> My parents were blessed with three children, with me being the first born. Growing up was not easy as we are of a humble background. But our parents did everything they could to give us a comfortable life. At times we could not afford to eat three meals a day; sometimes we would sleep hungry or even wake up to no breakfast at all. Our parents gave us hope for a better tomorrow and they ensured we concentrated in our books, as they say<em>"education is the key."</em> </p>
    <h4>Education</h4>
        <p>Getting the best education, is the dream of every parent for the child. My parents are not any different. They struggled to put me in a good school where they believed is where I would get a foundation of a better life in future.I dedicated myself to perform well and grasp everything we were being taught so as not to disappoint my parents. <br> Here is a summary of my education from the highest attained: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Moi University - Bachelor of Arts (Psychology)</li>
                <li>Mikinduri girls - Form1 to form4 (B plain)</li>
                <li>Timau junior academy - Class 1 to 8 (347 marks)</li>
            </ul>
    <h4>Work experience</h4>
        <p>Like a normal graduate would do; I started looking for a job after graduation. Before graduation, I was working but now with papers to prove I attended university; I dedicated myself to look for a "worthy" job. My work experience is a short jouney since I have worked in one formal place till date. I have worked at:  </p>
        <p> Kenya Institute of Community Development (Feb 2019 - March 2020) <br> I worked here for a period of one year. My main job description was training/tutoring students who were studying psychology or doing any other unit related with psychology.<br> My other responsibilities included:</p>
            <ol>

    <h4>Programming</h4>
        <p>I lost my job at KISCWD due to the Covid-19 pandemic. After losing the job, I sent so many applications but no positive answer was forth-coming. So since 2020 I have just been doing hustles here and there atleast to earn an income and put food on the table for my family. <br> Lack of employment on the field that I studied back in campus kept me thinking on what else I would do to change my life. This led me to trying out new skills and in the course of it, I came across a scholarship by mastercard for women to join Moringa and do programming. I took the opportunity and decided to give it a try and here iam now; doing programming. Reasons why am taking programming classes: </p> 
            <ol>
                <li>Career change. I decided to pursue programming as a career</li>
                <li>Gain new skills</li>
                <li>Be an inspiration to other women. I want them to know that they can achieve more than just being housewives or settling for less. </li>
                <li>I want to start a company in the near future</li>
            </ol>
