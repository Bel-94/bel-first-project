    <h2>About me</h2>
     <h3>My background</h3>
      <p>I was born and raised in Nanyuki. My parents were blessed with three children, with me being the first born. Growing up was not easy as we are of a humble background. But our parents did everything they could to give us a comfortable life. At times we could not afford to eat three meals a day; sometimes we would sleep hungry or even wake up to no breakfast at all. Our parents gave us hope for a better tomorrow and they ensured we concentrated in our books, as they say"education is the key." </p>
     <h4>Education</h4>
       <p>Getting the best education, is the dream of every parent for the child. My parents are not any different. They struggled to put me in a good school where they believed is where I would get a foundation of a better life in future.I dedicated myself to perform well and grasp everything we were being taught so as not to disappoint my parents. <br> Here is a summary of my education from the highest attained: </p>
         <ul>
             <li>Moi University - Bachelor of Arts (Psychology)</li>
             <li>Mikinduri girls - Form1 to form4 (B plain)</li>
             <li>Timau junior academy - Class 1 to 8 (347 marks)</li>
